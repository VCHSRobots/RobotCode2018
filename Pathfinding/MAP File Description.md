# .map File Description
 - The `.map` file's contents are JSON.
 - All valid elements must have a minimum of two pairs of points.
 - Coordinates for elements should be marked clockwise, starting from the lowest, and then leftmost coordinate pair. (IE lowest X,and then Y values)
 - All valid elements must have a solidity value:
    - `0`: Completely traversable.
    - `1`: Completely solid
 - Elements can also be "interactive": they can have lines (`InteractiveFaces`) which allow the robot to properly align itself with the location in order to perform some action at it. By default, if an element has an interactive "face", the robot will align with the nearest face when commanded to travel to that location.
    - If more than face one exists, one can be specified by index.
    - Only elements with faces can be used as pre-defined locations for the robot to travel to. (Example: `GOTO:FarLeftPortal`.) To make the robot travel to another area, use coordinate pairs, or define a new area in the configuration file.
 - "SIZE" is X, then Y.
 - The base unit is the inch. For example, the area of `{[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]}` would be one square inch.
