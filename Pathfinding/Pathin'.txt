0. Rio recieves instructions to move forward.
1. Rio sends a stream of encoder increments, and we update position along line.
2. As line position and orientation are updated, LIDAR scans are evaluated to determine *actual* position.
3. Any corrective information (most likely steering L/R) is passed to the Rio.
3.5. Corrective action will be required after drift exceeds either:
 - 5 degrees rotation variation, or
 - 2 units drift from the perpendicular of the current line on the path.
4. When the robot reaches it's expected position, as determined both by the encoder data and LIDAR scans, the loop ends.

Rendering information:

Actions are rendered as dark green circles.
Paths are bright green lines.
Anomolous Elements are shown in red, and are given a solidity of "2".
Virtual Elements are shown in white, and are given a solidity of "3". These are elements used in the PathFinding process. They are simply larger outlines of existing solid elements.
